# AstroStacker
This application is used for pre-processing astronomical images. For now,
here's what's working and what will be added:
##### Working
- Average stacking of image sets
- Calibrating lights with darks and bias frames
- Star alignment using triangle similarity
- Setting threshold of star detection

##### To-Do
- ECC and center-of-gravity alignment (first one is good for solar/lunar
  surfaces, second one is good for planetary images)
- Reading 8/16/32-bit FITS images and RAW DSLR images
- Writing to various formats, like FITS, TIFF
- More stacking methods (maximum, minimum)
- Pixel rejection algorithms for stacking
- Reduce size of needed libraries
- Add ability to stop stacking
- Mosaik stacking
- Add setting for weighting when using additive stacking

### Installation
1. Clone this git repository: `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/hamstersztyk/AstroStacker.git`
2. Install packages with PIP:
 - `pip install PyQt5`
 - `pip install numpy`
 - `pip install opencv-python`
 - `pip install scikit-image`
 - `pip install imutils`
 - `pip install astropy`
 - Note: you might want to install these dependencies with `--user` option.
 - Note: don't install PyQt5 if you have Qt already installed. If you're using
 Arch Linux or its derivative, install OpenCV this way:
    - `pacman -S opencv opencv-samples hdf5`

### How to use
1. Launch the application with `python gui.py`
2. Load needed frames (you need to provide light frames, dark, flat and bias
  frames are optional)
3. Test number of detected stars (more stars = slower, but more
  precise alignment)
4. Click "Stack" button to process the images
5. Final image will be saved in directory with light frames

### Testing with example images
I provided a small set of my own images for testing while developing in
`images` branch. You can download them using
`git clone -b images --single-branch https://github.com/hamstersztyk/AstroStacker.git`
